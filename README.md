Overview
The Romans were a powerful nation. They conquered most of Europe and ruled it for hundreds of years. One thing they never discovered though was the number zero. This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with is still in use today.

Make a simple program to convert digits to roman letter numbers (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) and to convert back romans number letter to digits.

 Sample Output
